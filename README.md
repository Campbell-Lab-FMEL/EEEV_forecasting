## Linking hosts, landscape and climate to advance zoonotic arbovirus forecasting

The R scripts provided here show the steps used to assemble sentinel chicken, climate, and land use data and to fit non-spatial, spatial, and spatiotemporal models in the manuscript in Review at _Scientific Reports_ (Preprint: https://doi.org/10.32942/X2VM0K)

Additional scripts provide code and steps used for variable selection, model evaluation on out-of-sample predictions, and monthly statewide predictions of EEEV seroconversion from 2005 to 2019.

Georeferenced sentinel chicken seroconversion data is available upon request through the Florida Department of Health Arbovirus Surveillance program upon agreement from participating Florida mosquito control programs through a memorandum of understanding. Contact information for data requests are available through the FDOH website: https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/surveillance.html.
